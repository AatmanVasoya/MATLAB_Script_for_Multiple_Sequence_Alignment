# MATLAB_Script_for_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment

## Introduction

Sequence alignment is a fundamental task in bioinformatics, playing a crucial role in various
applications such as phylogenetic analysis, protein structure prediction, and the identification of
functionally significant regions. Aligning multiple sequences is particularly important in
comparative genomics, as it enables the detection of conserved regions, single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), and missense mutations.
Identifying missense mutations is essential for understanding their potential impact on protein
structure and function, as well as their association with related disorders. SNPs can also have
functional consequences, such as altering gene expression or protein function, and are widely
studied in association with disease risk and drug response. Differentiating between SNPs and
missense mutations is a critical step in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of genetic
variations and their potential implications.
In this study, I present a MATLAB script that combines multiple FASTA files, performs multiple
sequence alignment, and identifies positions with missense mutations and amino acid differences
to differentiate SNP from missense mutation.
